# Lights Out - a KTANEModKit module

![Lights Out](https://ashbash1987.github.io/ktanemod-lightsout/Manual/img/Component.png "Lights Out")

Lights Out is an experimental module leveraging the newly-exposed KTANEModKit for 'Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes'. It features a representation of the classic 90's handheld game of the same name, in a needy module form-factor.

## The Manual

Visit https://ashbash1987.github.io/ktanemod-lightsout/Manual for a KTANE-like manual specifically for this module.

## Steam Workshop Installation

If you purchased _Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes_ through Steam, you'll be able to subscribe to the mod on the Steam Workshop; goto http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729573295 to subscribe to the Lights Out mod. This will download the module automatically for you, and will continue to download updates for the module when updates are released.

## Non-Steam Installation

If you didn't purchase 'Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes' through Steam, but you have a modpreview version to play on, then you can manually install the module instead of using the Steam Workshop.

Goto https://github.com/ashbash1987/ktanemod-lightsout/releases and download the latest release for the module.

Inside the *.zip file will be a folder called LightsOut; drop that folder into the `<path>/<to>/Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes/mods` folder. (If the folder doesn't exist, create one for it).
